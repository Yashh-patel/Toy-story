# Toy Story

**Toy Story** is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to create random stories using a set of pre-defined titles, actions, reactions, animals, and places. The app generates a creative story by combining random elements and can even read the story out loud using speech synthesis.

## Features
- Generate random stories based on preset categories (titles, actions, reactions, animals, places).
- Interactive buttons to build your own custom story step-by-step.
- Speech synthesis: The app can read the generated story aloud.
- Reset functionality: Clear the current story and stop speech with a single click.
- Random story generator: Create an entire random story at once.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
